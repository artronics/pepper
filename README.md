# Starter project for elm webpack and electron
A small boilerplate for elm project in electron platform. This project includes a counter example from elm website

## Install
clone this repo and run

`npm install`

`npm start dev`
## What you get:

* Make all your elm file
* Compile all scss file
* Auto watch (HMR)

## Directory structure
 All the source code should be in `src` directory. Put your `scss` file in `styles` directory.
 
## Issues
If you can not see the counter example try to run server and electron separately.
First run `node server.js` and then run `npm run start`
